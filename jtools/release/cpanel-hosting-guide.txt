1. Zip the contents of the `release/` folder (or upload the folder directly if allowed by your host).
2. In cPanel File Manager, navigate to your document root (commonly `public_html` or a subfolder for your site).
3. Upload the zip file and extract it there so `index.html`, `.htaccess`, and the `assets` folder sit directly in the target directory.
4. The included `.htaccess` provides a single-page-app rewrite so deep links like `/tools/json-formatter` resolve to the app entrypoint.
5. Visit your domain or subdomain to confirm the site loads correctly.
